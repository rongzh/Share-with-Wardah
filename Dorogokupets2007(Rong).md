# Dorogokupets 2007 notes
### What this experiment is about?
- This research simplifies the equations of states of Au, Pt, MgO, NaCl-B1, and NaCl-B2 on the basis of expanded Mie–Grüneisen-Debye(EMGD) model.
The research also reveals that the form of volume dependence of the Grüneisen parameter as well as the contribution of intrinsic anharmonicity are critical in construction of the EoS.
The cross-comparison of different EoS of materials with be conducted.

### Thermodynamics equations
Researchers exceed the bound of the classical Mie-Grüneisen-Debye EoS and take into account the additional contributions of intrinsic anharmonicity and free electrons in the Helmholtz free energy and obtain the new EoS.
- Helmholtz free energy equation: it describes both quasiharmonic part of the Helmholtz free energy and the intrinsic anharmonicity and electronic contribution.
By differentiation of the equation, researchers obtain equations of the entropy, pressure, isothermal bulk modulus, and slope of pressure at constant volume.

- Debye model(F_(qh)) in Helmholtz free energy equation: it is used to describe the quasiharmonic phonon part of the Helmholtz free energy. Again, researchers derive the equations of the entropy, pressure, isothermal bulk modulus, and slope of pressure at constant volume.

- The volume dependence of the Grüneisen parameter γ is taken from Al'tshuler et al.

### Calculations of the thermodynamic functions of MgO, Au and Pt in high P-T conditions
- Researchers provide a table of parameters of the EoS for MgO, Au and Pt with the current EMGD EoS.
- Data sets used to build current EMGD-EoS are:
1. bulk moduli measured by ultrasonic or Brillouin scattering techniques, mainly at ambient pressure and high temperature
2. heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient measured at ambient pressure and high temperature
3. Hugoniot data measured during shock-wave compression at high pressure and temperature
4. EoS measured by X-ray diffraction in static devices under high pressure and ambient or high temperature
- Isochors for Au, Pt, and MgO are calculated from EMGD EoS with parameters, and these isochors are close to the one obtained with a more advanced formalism, which indicates that the EMGD EoS can be used for simultaneous analysis for data above 300K.
- Cross-comparison of new EoS of Au, Mg, MgO, NaCl-B2 with those from bibliography is also conducted.
- Direct comparisons with Fei et al. of EoSs of Au, Pt, and MgO are also conducted.

### Discussion of the result
####Au
- The EoS of Au have varied K' (between 5 and 6.12). 
But the quasihydrostatic ruby pressure calibration would have been more suitable than the non-hydrostatic scale.
So the K' would be increased to 5.8.
- Researchers also have very low parameter q, which is in agreement with Anderson et al.
- The EoS of Au in reference has a volume function dependent with γ, as it takes into account of the intrinsic anharmonicity. This also agrees well with the new EoS of Au.

#### MgO
- EMGD-EoS agrees well with previous studies at ambient condition, but not at high temperature condition.

#### Pt
- Pt shows the largest deviation from Debye-like behavior.

#### Reasons for the differences between EoS of MgO, Au, and Pt.
- The result has opposite result with Mao et al. ruby scale, which is the self-consensus measurement of the EoS of MgO by combining Brillouin and X-ray diffraction measurement up to 55GPa.
The EoS was calculated a ruby scale in that research, which is close to the calibration of MaO et al. up to 55GPa.
But the new EoS also agrees Brillouin measurement with a small systematic difference in pressure on a room-temperature isotherm.
- As for the underestimation of the role of functional dependence of the Grüneisen parameter on the volume, Grüneisen parameter has been used in the EoS as a coefficient of proportionality, its logarithmic derivative q are also included in equations. 
Shock-wave data, experimental information on heat capacity, bulk moduli, volume as well as the thermal expansion coefficient at zero temperature are taken into consideration in this new EoS.
- For the consideration of additional contributions such as intrinsic anharmonicity and free electrons to the Helmholtz free energy, they are non-zero but having opposite signs for Pt.
They have significant effect on periclase and platinum results.
However, their effect are huge only at low temperature.

#### Fei's study
- Fei did correct the previous versions of EoS of Au and Pt, confirm the quasihydrostatic ruby scales.
However, they still have questions about high temperature formulation of the EoS of Au and Pt.
They did not consider additional contributions mentioned above, so the calculated parameters do not agree better with experimental measurements than former EoS. 
As a result, the pressures calculated using Fei et al's EoSs are higher than pressures given by EMGD-EoS at high temperature.
