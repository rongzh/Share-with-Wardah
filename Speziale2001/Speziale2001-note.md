### What did they do?

- room temperature (300 K) static compression of periclase (MgO) under near hydrostatic conditions using energy dispersive synchrotron XRD in a diamond anvil cell with methanol-ethanol (to 10 GPa) or helium (to 52 GPa) as a pressure-transmitting medium.
- allows precise determination of the cell parameter and an improved EOS of MgO.
- the pressure derivative of bulk modulus was found to be 3.99;0.01
- logarithmic volume dependence was found to be 74.70;0.01
- developed a model where *q* decreases with compression from 1.65 at 0.1 MPa to 0.01 at 200 GPa, which within the framework of the Mie-Gruneisen-Debye assumptions, satisfactorily describes the low-pressure static data and the high pressure Hugoniot data.
- shows that it is possible to develop a simple model of the volume dependence of the Gruneisen parameter that can successfully describe the P-V-T EOS of MgO from ambient conditions to 203 GPa and 3663 K.
