### What did they do?

- reported new P-V-T EOS of gold (Au) based on the inversion of quasi-hydrostatic compression and shockwave data using the Mie-Gruneisen relation and the Birch-Murnaghan-Debye equation.
- pressure derivative of bulk modulus was found to be 5.0;0.2
- logarithmic volume dependence was found to be 1.0;0.1 from fitting to the Birch-Murnaghan and Gruneisen equations.
- inversion includes electronic contribution in the fitted Gruneisen parameter as well as the phonon contribution. 
- at 660 km depth conditions, the new EOS yields ~1.0 GPa higher pressure than Anderson et al.'s EOS that has been used in multi anvil cells experiments.
- after correction, there still exists a 1.5 GPa discrepancy between post-spinel boundary measured by multi anvil studies and the 660-km discontinuity.
