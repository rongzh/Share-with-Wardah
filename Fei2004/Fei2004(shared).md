###What are these and how do they relate to each other?
- internal pressure standards? - Au, Pt, MgO, W, Mo, Pd, Ag.
- multi-anvil experiment, ruby fluorescence pressure gauge used at room temperature
- synchrotron XRD
- pressure scale
- equations of state - a set of equations that relate P-V-T
- Mie-Gruneisen relation
- Brillouin scattering

	1. use XRD and multi-anvil experiments on different pressure standards to get data
	2. use data to get equation of state of different pressure standards
	3. equation of state creates pressure scales
	4. try to get pressure scales of the same pressure standard that agree with each other
	5. try to get consistent pressure scales of different pressure standards.

###Why do we need a correct pressure scale?
- geoscientists all over the world conduct high P-T experiments using different methods, mainly XRD, shockwave experiments and theoretical calculations. We need a consistent pressure scale so that ideally, everyone's data would agree with each other (at high temperature) to some degree.
- once we have agreeable data and a consistent pressure scale, we would be able to better understand the behavior of materials in the deep earth, especially at seismic discontinuity boundaries, where a lot of mineral transformations occur. 

###Uncertainty in thermal pressure
- due to different equations of state for different internal pressure standards
	- Au: 
		- Gold as an extensive used internal pressure standard has more than 4 different 						thermal equations causing significantly difference in pressure for specific volumes.
		- 4 equations of state (Jamieson, Heinz and Jeanloz, Anderson, Shim)
		- difference can be as large as 2.5GPa at 25Gpa and 2000K.
	- MgO: 
		- MgO as an internal pressure scale studied by shock and static compression experiments as well as theoretical calculations also has differences around 0.5 GPa to 2 GPa.
		- Jamieson's scale is 2GPa below Speziale's at 25GPa and 2000K.
		- Matsui's scale (EOS) is in general agreement with Speziale's over a wide range of P and T, but is ~0.5GPa lower at 660km seismic discontinuity.
	* Both Au's and Mgo's thermal equations from different studies based on the same X-ray diffraction data have large discrepancy.(Fig.1)

	- NaCl: 
		- NaCl pressure scale from Decker and the revised one by Brown based on multi-anvil experiments both have inaccurate estimation of pressure.
		- Decker's was used prior to 1998, Brown's scale differs by 0.3GPa at high T
	        (>700K). 	   						   
	- Pt pressure scales:
		- Pt pressure scales are generally in agreement. 
However, they are all based on shock wave data, which cannot make a extensive comparison between different pressure scales. 
		- Jamieson's and Holmes' are in general agreement, but the scales
	  were developed based on shockwave data only, haven't been evaluated by comparing 
	  static high P-T data.
- different pressure scales due to reliance on different methods in obtaining data; either
  shockwave or independently derived thermodynamic parameters.
	- Ex: Jamieson(1982) depended on shockwave data for Au scale, Anderson(1989) relied on 
	  thermodynamic parameters consistent with high T elasticity measurements at ambient
	  pressure.

###What did they do and what did they get:
- conduct high P-T multi-anvil experiments on different pressure standards simultaneously 
  to get data under the same P-T conditions
- proposed a set of equations of states that would produce consistent pressure scales.
- used XRD to get unit cell parameters of different pressure standards (Au, Pt, MgO)
- used the volume obtained to calculate the pressure based on different pressure scales
- quantitatively compare these Pressure values to create an EOS that produce mutually consistent results of pressure determination at high T.

####The experiment:
* A high P-T experiments using multi-anvil experiment to obtain X-ray diffraction data, and then to make comparisons between answers of different equations of states from previous studies.
* MgO and Au pressure scales are compared and the researchers made pressure consistant by adjusting the parameter of q.
Researcher in this study are favor of using the MgO scale of Speziale et al.(2001).
* Au and Pt pressure scales are compared and the parameter K^(')_(OT) is adjusted.
* The researchers also conducted several experiments using W, Mo, Pd, and Ag as internal standards.
However, these material cannot be ideal internal standards since they all become chemically reactive and easily oxidized under high oxygen fugacity conditions.

####The results:
* By comparing other internal pressure standards with other studies, it is proved that the new thermal equation of state for Pt is consistent with the modified Au scale and MgO scale of Speziale et al.(2001).
* In this study the parameter q is treated as constant in different high P-T conditions.
But when shock wave data and static P-T are fitted, whether q is still constant needed further studies to demonstrate. 
* Researchers suggested that a new equations of state of Au and Pt that can be consistent with the MgO scale from Speziale et al.(2001).
