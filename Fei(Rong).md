#Reading notes: Fei's Toward an Internally Consistent Pressure Scale
##Abstract:

Seismic observations require accurate pressure scale measurements up to 364GPa at high pressure, however, pressure scales solely based on the **reduced shock-wave equations** of state have variations up to 7% in high pressure conditions, which makes it difficult to understand the seismic discontinuities and chemical composition of the earth's interior.
Researchers used the compression data of gold(Au), platinum(Pt), the NaCl-B2 phase, and slid neon(Ne) at 300K and high P-T conditions.
Date collected were used to compute the thermal equations of state of Au, Pt, NaCl-B2, and solid Ne.
In this way, this consistent pressure scales can provide reliable baseline for comparing high P-T experiment data with observations as well as theoretical calculations, thus advance the understanding of the interior earth.

##Background and Recent Studies:

* The ruby luminescent pressure gauge adopted to be a practical pressure scale for diamond-anvil cell at room temperature. 
For example, Mao ruby scale was calibrated up to 80 GPa with the use of reduced shock-wave equations of state of Cu and Ag. However, studies show that this scale underestimate pressure above 40 GPa.
* Also, different experiments showed that the Pt and Au scale differ in 100 GPa and ambient temperature.
The discrepancy between Au and Pt scales at room temperature mainly caused the inaccurate ruby scale as well as the uncertainties in thermal equations of the state.
It is because of the inconsistency of pressure scales among different metals that leads to the uncertainties in determining pressure at high temperature.
* As a result, this study reports the data on Au and Pt as pressure calibrants and propose internally consistent P-V-T thermal equations of state of Au and Pt.
In addition, the *in situ* x-ray diffraction measurements of neon and NaCl up to megabar pressure at room temperature and high temperature.
* Researchers proposed two Ne and NaCl-B2 pressure scales that are consistent with the Pt and Au pressure scales and ruby scale.
* Formula used:
1.the third order Birth-Murnaghan equation 
2.Vinet equation of state
3.Mie-Gru^(..)neisen relation

##Results

* X-ray diffraction data on Au in Ne pressure medium with laser-heating annealing up to 89 GPa.(Fig.1)
* Model parameters for the equations of state of NaCl-B2, solid Ne, Au, and Pt(Table 1)
* Compression data of the NaCl-B2 phase at 300K(Fig.3)
* The compression data of the NaCl-B2 phase at 1000K from 98 to 34GPa obtained by combining the synchrotron x-ray diffraction and externally heated diamond-anvil cell techniques(Fig.4)
