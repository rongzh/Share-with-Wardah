#Fei2004 Note
##What have been done before this experiment:
* Gold as an extensive used internal pressure standard has more than 4 different thermal equations causing significantly difference in pressure for specific volumes.
* MgO as an internal pressure scale studied by shock and static compression experiments as well as theoretical calculations also has differences around 0.5 GPa to 2 GPa.
* Both Au's and Mgo's thermal equations from different studies based on the same X-ray diffraction data have large discrepancy.(Fig.1)
* NaCl pressure scale from Decker and the revised one by Brown based on multi-anvil experiments both have inaccurate estimation of pressure.
* Pt pressure scales are generally in agreement. 
However, they are all based on shock wave data, which cannot make a extensive comparison between different pressure scales.

Thus, as different ways of experiments(shock wave data, independent thermodynamic parameters, etc.) are conducted, huge differences are caused.

##What does this experiment do?
* A high P-T experiments using multi-anvil experiment to obtain X-ray diffraction data, and then to make comparisons between answers of different equations of states from previous studies.
* MgO and Au pressure scales are compared and the researchers made pressure consistant by adjusting the parameter of q.
Researcher in this study are favor of using the MgO scale of Speziale et al.(2001).
* Au and Pt pressure scales are compared and the parameter K^(')_(OT) is adjusted.
* The researchers also conducted several experiments using W, Mo, Pd, and Ag as internal standards.
However, these material cannot be ideal internal standards since they all become chemically reactive and easily oxidized under high oxygen fugacity conditions.

##What are the results of the experiment?
* By comparing other internal pressure standards with other studies, it is proved that the new thermal equation of state for Pt is consistent with the modified Au scale and MgO scale of Speziale et al.(2001).
* In this study the parameter q is treated as constant in different high P-T conditions.
But when shock wave data and static P-T are fitted, whether q is still constant needed further studies to demonstrate. 
* Researchers suggested that a new equations of state of Au and Pt that can be consistent with the MgO scale from Speziale et al.(2001).
