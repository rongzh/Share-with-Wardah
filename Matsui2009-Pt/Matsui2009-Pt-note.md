# Matsui2009-Pt note
## Researcher measured the T-P-V data of Pt up to 1600K and 42GPa, and find that the new EOS of Pt is consistent with both shock compression data, volume thermal expansion data and the recently T-P-V data measured.
Researchers also compare the calculated pressure by using the new EOS with the existed pressure scale such as MgO from Matsui2000, and Dewaele2004.
## Experiments: Kawai-type multianvil high pressure apparatus and sintered diamond anvils.
